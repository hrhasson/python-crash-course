# Python for high schoolers
A brief intro to python course based on jbchampagne/pythontutorials (undergrad level), as well as a series of notebooks explaining filtering with Fourier transforms

Please note that these notebooks were built to be run via Google Colaboratory, but they work just fine with jupyter notebooks. You can download these and upload them to Colab and use as intended, or open with Jupyter and just change the import statements for the files used.

## Intro to Python course
This directory has 3 files for a 3-day introduction to python for high school level (Day1.ipynb, Day2.ipynb, Day3.ipynb). This course is quite condensed, and some concepts may be too high level (especially Day 3). Each day has interactive questions within the "lecture," so instructors should pause and let students work these problems individually or together as you go along. The solutions to these problems are in each Day(X)_solutions.ipynb file.

Days 1 and 2 were each taught in ~90 minute interactive sessions over zoom in August 2020. Day 3 was not taught, but given to students as optional extra content. The Exercises.ipynb file has some practice problems corresponding to each day, and Exercises_with_solutions.ipynb has the solutions to those.

## Filtering with Fourier transforms
This is a mini-course for students after they have completed at least Days 1 and 2 of the Intro to Python course above.
