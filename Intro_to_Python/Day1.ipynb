They have a mix of text cells and code cells, the latter of which you can execute by clicking the \"play\" button in the top left of the cell, or by hitting **Shift-Enter**. The whole notebook is automatically saved periodically, but you can also save the outputs from your code as text files, plots, or images separate from the notebook.
